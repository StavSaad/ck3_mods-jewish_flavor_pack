Your courtiers whisper, some in awe, some in fear, but your eyes gleam with a singular, fervent vision. The scrolls you've pored over, the strange voices only you hear, and the undeniable pull of forgotten lore have culminated in this grand, audacious decree. Prepare for a journey into the past, where the gods of old may yet whisper their forgotten names, and the very foundations of your realm could be shaken by the echoes of a long-lost civilization."
